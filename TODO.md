The main menu of the app should provide easy access to its core features while maintaining a user-friendly and intuitive design. Here's a suggested main menu structure for the CraftLog app:

**Dashboard:**

The dashboard provides a quick overview of your financial status, recent notes, upcoming events, and any important notifications.

**Financials:**

This section includes features for managing your financial data, such as:
* Budget
* Expenses
* Investments
* Reports

**Notes:**

The Notes section is for organizing and managing your notes. It should include options like:
* Create New Note
* Note Categories or Tags
* Search and Filter Notes

**Planning:**

This section is dedicated to planning and scheduling, including:
* Create and Manage Plans
* Calendar View
* Reminders and Notifications
* TODO lists

**Events:**

* Here, you can manage your events, appointments, and meetings, with features like:
* Create New Event
* Event Calendar
* Event Reminders

**Settings:**

The Settings section should allow users to customize the app according to their preferences. It can include options for:
* Account and Security Settings
* Data Backup and Sync
* App Theme and Preferences
* Help & Support - A dedicated section for FAQs, tutorials, and contacting customer support if users have questions or issues.
* About: - Information about the app, version, and any relevant legal or licensing details.

Remember to design the menu in a clear and visually appealing way, with easily recognizable icons or labels, so that users can quickly access the functions they need. Additionally, you can consider offering a search bar or a prominent "Quick Add" button on the main menu to enhance user convenience and efficiency.
